%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Code Structures %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1 SCMSimulator.m is the main program.
2 SCMSimulatro.fig is the Matlab-based Graphic User Interface (GUI) program. A user-friendly operation interface.
3 RMS_DS.m is small function for calculating RMS delay spread, 
4 createXXXXX.m serials are used for curve fitting, which are full of redundancy and irregularities. 
It will be simplified in next version.
5 many .mat are data library to be used in the main program. They are all produced during former sparse
analysis which are available with most sparse analysis programs. The author will put away some examples for references
6 logo pictures are school marks.

Thanks for your reading.
